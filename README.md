# 🕉️ Pali Language NLP Project

## 📘 Overview
This project aims to process and analyze ancient **Pali language texts** using modern **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.  
The main goal is to clean, structure, and interpret traditional Pali scriptures and make them computationally readable for research, linguistic analysis, and digital preservation.

---

## 🧠 Objectives
- To create **clean and normalized text corpora** from raw Pali scriptures.  
- To handle **Pali-specific challenges** like:
  - Replacement of symbols (e.g., `pe०`)
  - Multiple textual variants
  - Complex punctuation and markers
- To perform **morphological, syntactic, and semantic analysis** on the processed texts.
- To prepare datasets for further **machine learning and linguistic research**.

## ⚙️ Project Structure

| Task No. | Description | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| 0 | Create ready-to-read text (replace `pe०`, remove variants, handle punctuation) | ✅ Planned |
| 1 | Process **Sāmaññaphala Sutta (सामञ्‍ञफलसुत्तं)** — Tokenization, Cleaning, and Text Structuring | 🚧 In Progress |
| 2 | POS tagging and morphological analysis | ⏳ Pending |
| 3 | Lexical database and translation alignment | ⏳ Pending |
| 4 | Semantic relation mapping and Pali-English glossary generation | ⏳ Pending |

## 🧩 Tools & Libraries
- **Python 3.x**
- **NLTK / spaCy (custom models for Pali)**
- **Regular Expressions (Regex)**
- **Pandas / JSON** for database management
- **Jupyter Notebook / VS Code** for analysis
